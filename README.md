# Home_automation
Project in C++ that uses a arduino uno with some modlues as Bluetooth, RTC, OLED display and an android app (build in MIT app inventor) to automate some devices in a house.
This project is my first project using arduino enviroment and I applied this system to my house.
In this project I need to develop an android app to to show a UI with informations regarding the current parameters values and control the system through bluetooth, this app has voice control and softkeys that can access the bluettoh module and send the messages.
```
On app it was possible:
- Send voice commands
- Send commands using softkeys
- Schedule actions (i.e., turn on TV)
- See weather information
```
